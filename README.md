## üöÄ About the Project

VIBE_WEAVERS is an exploration of modern web technologies like **Three.js** for 3D graphics, **Rapier.js** for physics, and **PeerJS** for P2P connectivity ‚Äî all within a single HTML file for simplicity.  
The project is being developed with the help of an AI as a way to learn programming and game development.  
It can also be used as a template and modified into an interactive 3D personal website.
